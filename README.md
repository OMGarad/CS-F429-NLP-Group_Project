# Literature Shelves and Relations
Created in partial fulfillment of the requirements of CS F429: Natural Language Processing (BITS Pilani K K Birla Goa Campus)

## Part 1 -
This code divides research papers into shelves and sub-shelves in a hierarchical manner using [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) and [spacy](https://spacy.io/). An LDA model forms the basis for the clustering algorithm.

## Part 2 -
Citation graph added based on the results in Part 1. Also predicts similarity measures of new literature using Jaccard score.
